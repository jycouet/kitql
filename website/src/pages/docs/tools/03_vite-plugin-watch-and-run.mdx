# 👀 How to - `vite-plugin-watch-and-run`

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  _**KitQL** itself is not a library, it's "nothing" but a collection of standalone libraries._
</Callout>

Adding watch mode to any command / Tool!

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D vite-plugin-watch-and-run
```

## Configuration

Add `watchAndRun` plugin with the following configuration:

- `watch`: a glob pattern to watch for changes. This will be matched against the **absolute path**
  for altered files.
- `run`: a command to trigger when a file change is detected (You can be very creative 🥳!)

```js filename="vite.config.js"
import path from 'path'
import { watchAndRun } from 'vite-plugin-watch-and-run'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    watchAndRun([
      {
        name: 'gen',
        watch: path.resolve('src/**/*.(gql|svelte)'),
        run: 'npm run gen'
        // watchKind: ['add', 'change', 'unlink'], // (default)
        // delay: 300                              // (default)
      }
    ])
  ]
}
```

## Side Notes

- Full list of `watchKind` can be found here: https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#api

- `delay` is good in case you have 200 files added realy fast! Like this the cmd is executed only
  once.

- For the `run` command we recommend to use `npm run xxx` as it will work for `npm`, `yarn` and
  `pnpm` 🙃

- `watch` infos
  - You can use glob patterns to watch for changes under the root directory.

```js
{
  watch: path.resolve('**/*.ts')
}
```

- You can use absolute path to watch for changes on a specific file on your machine. That's useful
  if you want to watch for changes on a file that is in your monorepo for example!

```js
{
  watch: path.resolve('../../README.md')
}
```

- You can also go with `watchFile` that is a function that will be called with the filepath. Inside,
  you can decide what to do.
