# ðŸ‘€ How to - `vite-plugin-watch-and-run`

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D vite-plugin-watch-and-run
```

## Configuration

Add `watchAndRun` plugin with the following configuration:

- `watch`: a glob pattern to watch for changes. This will be matched against the _absolute path_ for
  altered files.
- `run`: a command to trigger when a file change is detected (You can be very creative ðŸ¥³!)

```js filename="vite.config.js"
import path from 'path'
import watchAndRun from 'vite-plugin-watch-and-run'

/** @type {import('vite').UserConfig} */
const config = {
  plugins: [
    watchAndRun([
      {
        name: 'gen',
        watchKind: ['add', 'change', 'unlink'],
        watch: path.resolve('src/**/*.(gql|svelte)'),
        run: 'npm run gen',
        delay: 300
      }
    ])
  ]
}

export default config
```

## Side Notes

- Full list of `watchKind` can be found here: https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#api

- `delay` is good in case you have 200 files added realy fast! Like this the cmd is executed only
  once.

- For the `run` command we recommend to use `npm run xxx` as it will work for `npm`, `yarn` and
  `pnpm` ðŸ™ƒ
