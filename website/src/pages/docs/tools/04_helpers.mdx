We want to have something light.

This is the "full" size. But, code splitting is always in mind so that you ship as less as possible
in the browser! _(Check out by selecting what you use)_

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @kitql/helpers
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Nice & styled logs

- In terminal & browser _(Don't think about SSR & CSR, just enjoy ðŸŒˆ)_
- Very fast & very lightweight _(browser)_
- out-of-the-box simple ðŸ˜…

#### Example 1

Organize logs with `SQL` as prefix. _(Imagine you have multiple modules)_

```ts
import { green, Log, yellow } from '@kitql/helpers'

const logSQL = new Log('SQL')

logSQL.info(`Check out the ${yellow(`yellow`)} information`)
logSQL.info(`Or the ${green(`green`)} one!`)
```

## ðŸ’¤ Sleep

You want to wait a bit? Just sleep for `x` ms.

```ts
await sleep(5000)
```

## ðŸ‘‹ stringify

```ts
import { stry } from '@kitql/helpers'

const obj = { value: 7 }

stry(obj) // same as JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)
```

Are 2 objects equal? _(deep compare)_

```ts
import { stryEq } from '@kitql/helpers'

const obj1 = { value: 7 }
const obj2 = { value: 6 }

strEq(obj1, obj2) // false
```
