# ⚡Let's go All-In!

KitQL is primarily a list of tools/projects working together. You can opt-in or out of each any
time, but we think that here you will find the _best in class_ way to do graphql from top to bottom!

_In order to not repeat ourself **20** times, we have a dedicated page per package and the overview
here 👍_

## Create SvelteKit project

Create a new SvelteKit project.

```sh
npm create svelte my-graphql-app
```

We recommend typescript, eslint, playwright, ... so answer `yes` to everything 🙃!

## Install `KitQL`

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @kitql/all-in
npm i houdini
npm i graphql@15.8.0
```

Then depending on your needs, you can configure packages individually.

## Configuration by package

### KitQL

Create everything you need for your endpoint.

--> [Configuration guide](/docs/setup/02_server)

### GraphQL Client - Houdini

This package will take care of the frontend part of GraphQL. Typically, you will be able to use
`queries`, `mutations` and `subscriptions` in your components & routes in an effortless manner!

--> [Configuration guide](/docs/setup/01_houdini)

### Vite Plugin - watch and run

This package will watch some files and trigger a command. We will use it to regenerate some graphql
on some files changes.
