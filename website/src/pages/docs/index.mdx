# Introduction

This library is built exclusively for [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), leveraging each and
every possibility of this fantastic way of building apps.

Other trendy GraphQL frameworks tend to be compatible with all major frameworks, leading to
concessions. That's definitely not the case with KitQL! We want the best developer experience to
build apps with SvelteKit & GraphQL. From tooling to client and server! All best practices combine
in one place.

So welcome to a new world! ðŸ¥³

<Callout>
FYI, `@kitql/all-in` has been deprecated as it's just a wrapper arround [The
Guild](https://the-guild.dev/) tools. I recommend you to use the tools directly if you want to
update versions.

In parallel, we are working on a new version of `@kitql/???` that will be much more powerful and
flexible. Still with [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev/) tooling, adding
[Remult](https://remult.dev/), [lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/) to the flow... Stay tuned!
