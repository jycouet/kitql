# Introduction

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  _**KitQL** itself is not a library, it's "nothing" but a collection of standalone libraries._
</Callout>

Over the years, we have been building a lot of apps with Svelte & SvelteKit, and we keep repeating
same things over and over again. So we decided to build libraries that will help us SpeedRun our
WebApps development.

You have some general questions? We have some answers! 🤞 check out our [F.A.Q.](/docs/faq)

## Synergies with KitQL

Not directly related to KitQL, but we are using them a lot, and they are working great with KitQL !

- 🎩 [Houdini](https://houdinigraphql.com/) - The "disappearing" GraphQL client. If you are using
  GraphQL, this is our favorite client.
- 🟦 [Remult](https://remult.dev/) - No code / low code / full code. Why Choosing when you can get
  everything ? 🚧 WIP 🚧
