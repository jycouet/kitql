# Pagination

Essentially, you can find two kinds of pagination in your application.

- Page by Page
- Infinite Scroll

Here is how it looks like:

<br />
## Page by page

This not more, not less than a regular query with some variables to control the pagination.

Nothing special here. Note just that Houdini will of course cache results for you, so going back on page 1 will
not require a new network call.

<br />
## Infinite Scroll

Here, Houdini makes it easy to load more data and append a list. Taking care of already cached data & co.

More information about this can be found directly in [Houdini's documentation](https://www.houdinigraphql.com/guides/pagination).
