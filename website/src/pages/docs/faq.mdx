# FAQ

## I don't use GraphQL, can I still use KitQL ?

<u>Yes</u> ! Acutally, most of the packages are not related to GraphQL at all.

Kit**QL** stands for Kit**Quick Libraries**, or Kit**Quick Layer** or Kit**Quality of Life**... We
don't know yet! You have a great idea ? Ping us! ðŸ˜‰

## Why it's not only 1 package ?

<u>Because</u>... you might not need everything, so we decided to split it into multiple packages.
But still, we built all of them to work together, with some common principles. That's why it's in a
Mono-Repo.

## Where is `@kitql/all-in` ?

<u>It's gone</u> ! It was a wrapper around a lot of packages from The Guild that you can do yourself.
Ping us if you need help.
