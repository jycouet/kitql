# ⚡GraphQL Client - Houdini

## Initial setup

To setup Houdini, you need to configure a few things in your project. And to make things easy, you
can simply do:

```sh
npx houdini init
```

And that's it 🎉🎉🎉

## Specials with KitQL

Defaults of Houdini are great 👍. We list here a few tweaks to know that integrates well with KitQL.

### Houdini's Tweaks

Nice convention:

- `*.gql` for operations (client)
- `*.graphql` for typedefs (endpoint, graphql type definition)

```js filename="houdini.config.js"
/** @type {import('houdini').ConfigFile} */
const config = {
  schemaPath: 'src/**/*.graphql'
}

export default config
```
