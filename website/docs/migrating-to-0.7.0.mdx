# Migrating to 0.7.0

Lotâ€™s changed in v0.7.0. Hopefully this guide should help you understand those changes as well as
show you what you should update to work with the new features. If you want some more context about the "why", please have a look at
the [blog post](https://www.the-guild.dev/blog/houdini-and-kitql) we wrote.

<br />
## What changed

The biggest change for KitQL users is that generated stores are done from Houdini now instead of KitQL Client package.

<br />
Here is the list of things to update:

1. Bump your `@kitlql/all-in` version to 0.7.x

1. The file `.graphqlrc.yaml` doesn't hold any client info for generation [ðŸ‘‡](#graphqlrcyaml-file)

1. Configure Houdini, follow this [guide](/docs/setup/01_houdini). **_And comeback here!_**

1. To migrate a big project, you can in `houdini.config.js` add `disableMasking: true`

1. Usage update [ðŸ‘‡](#usage-update)

<br />
### .graphqlrc.yaml file

- If you were using `KitQL` only in a client context, you should probably strip down your `.graphqlrc.yaml` file down to

```yaml
# file .graphqlrc.yaml

projects:
  # You can add multiple projects and generate with -p args
  default:
    # ðŸ‘‡ For vscode-graphql and intellisense
    schema:
      - ./src/lib/graphql/schema.json
      # - ./src/**/*.graphql
      - ./$houdini/graphql/schema.graphql
    documents:
      - ./src/**/*.gql
      - ./$houdini/graphql/documents.gql
```

Do not forget to remove the generate cmd of your `package.json`. (`graphql-codegen --config ./.graphqlrc.yaml`)


<br /><br />
- If you were already using the server side, follow the config [here](/docs/setup/02_server#code-generator).


<br />
### Usage update

1. functions `.query()` & `.queryLoad()` were renamed to `.fetch()`
1. prefix `KQL_` is now `GQL_`
1. `$lib/graphql/_kitql/graphqlStores` is most of the case replaced by `$houdini`
1. variables inputs `STOREQueryVariables` is now `STORE$input`
1. Fragment `XXXFragment` => `xXX$data`


Before:

```svelte
<script context="module" lang="ts">
  import { KQL_FirstQuery } from '$lib/graphql/_kitql/graphqlStores'

  export async function load({ fetch, url, params, session, stuff }) {
    await KQL_FirstQuery.queryLoad({ fetch })
    return {}
  }
</script>

{$GQL_FirstQuery.data.hello}
```

After:

```svelte
<script context="module" lang="ts">
  import { browser } from '$app/env'
  import { GQL_FirstQuery } from '$houdini'
  import type { Load } from '@sveltejs/kit'

  export const load: Load = async (event) => {
    await GQL_FirstQuery.fetch({ event })
    return {}
  }
</script>

<script>
  $: browser && GQL_FirstQuery.fetch()
</script>

{$GQL_FirstQuery.data.hello}
```

<br />
