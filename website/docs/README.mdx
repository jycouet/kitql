# Introduction

This library is built exclusively for [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), leveraging each and every possibility of this fantastic way of building apps.

Other trendy GraphQL frameworks tend to be compatible with all major frameworks, leading to concessions. That's definitely not the case with KitQL! We want the best developer experience to build apps with SvelteKit & GraphQL. From tooling to client and server! All best practices combine in one place.

So welcome to a new world! 🥳

Here, we write a straightforward operation, and everything is generated for you, ready to be used in your routes (with SSR), in your component (with caching)!
