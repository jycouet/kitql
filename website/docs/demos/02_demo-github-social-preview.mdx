## ⚡How to start?

_Notes:_

- I'm using [volta](https://volta.sh/) as node manager.
  - If you have it, when you will run `yarn` (to install everything), volta will grab the version of node and yarn specified in the `package.json`.
  - If you don't have it, you will have to install node (>=16) and yarn (or other package managers) yourself.
- I'm using `yarn` as package manager.
  - In `yarn.lock` you are able to see pinned versions of dependencies. _(I'm trying to be always up to date)_
  - You can use other package managers, but you will need to adapt some scripts (`prepare` and the `watchAndRun` vite plugin.)

```bash
# Get the demo app (will create a folder: kitql-github-social-preview)
npx degit github:jycouet/kitql/examples/demo-github-social-preview kitql-github-social-preview

# Navigate to the new folder
cd kitql-github-social-preview
```

To continue, follow the [online README.MD](https://github.com/jycouet/kitql/tree/main/examples/demo-github-social-preview) or the the one you just cloned.
