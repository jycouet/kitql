# ⚡Let's go All-In!

KitQL is primarily a list of tools/projects working together. You can opt-in or out of each any time,
but we think that here you will find the _best in class_ way to do graphql from top to bottom!

_In order to not repeat ourself **20** times, we have a dedicated page per package and the overview here 👍_

<br />
## Create SvelteKit project

Create a new SvelteKit project or upgrade to a least `next-350` version.

```sh
npm create svelte my-app
```

We recommend typescript, eslint, playwright, ... so answer `yes` to everything 🙃!

<br />
## Install `KitQL`

The package `@kitql/all-in` will add all your dependencies so that you can worry only about your app!

<PackageInstall packages={['@kitql/all-in', 'graphql']} />

Then depending on your needs, you can configure packages individually.

<br />
## Configuration by package

### GraphQL Client - Houdini

This package will take care of the frontend part of GraphQL. Typically, you will be able to
use `queries`, `mutations` and `subscriptions` in your components & routes in an effortless manner!

--> [Configuration guide](/docs/setup/01_houdini)

<br />
### GraphQL Server

This set of packages will take care of the backend part of GraphQL in SvelteKit

--> [Configuration guide](/docs/setup/02_server)

<br />
### Vite Plugin - watch and run

This package will watch some files and trigger a command. We will use it to regenerate some graphql on some files changes.
