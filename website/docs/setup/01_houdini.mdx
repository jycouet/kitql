# ⚡GraphQL Client - Houdini

## Initial setup

To setup Houdini, you need to configure a few things in your project. 
And to make things easy, you can simply do:

```sh
npx houdini init
```

And that's it 🎉🎉🎉

_For more info, check out the complete guide 
[setting-up-your-project](https://www.houdinigraphql.com/guides/setting-up-your-project#starting-a-new-project)
on Houdini directly._

<br />
## Specials with KitQL

Defaults of Houdini are great 👍.
We list here a few tweaks to know that integrates well with KitQL.

<br />
### Houdini's Tweaks

Nice convention: 
- `*.gql` for operations (client)
- `*.graphql` for typedefs (endpoint, graphql type definition)

Example 👇

<br />
```js 
/* file: houdini.config.js */

/** @type {import('houdini').ConfigFile} */
const config = {
	schemaPath: 'src/**/*.graphql',
};

export default config;
```
