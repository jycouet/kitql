# ⚡GraphQL Client - Houdini

## Initial setup

To setup Houdini, you need to configure a few things in your project. 
And to make things easy, you can simply do:

```sh
npx houdini init
```

And that's it 🎉🎉🎉

_For more info, check out the complete guide 
[setting-up-your-project](https://www.houdinigraphql.com/guides/setting-up-your-project#starting-a-new-project)
on Houdini directly._

## Specials with KitQL

Defaults of Houdini are great 👍.
We list here a few tweaks to know that integrates well with KitQL.

<br />
### Houdini's Tweaks

1/ If you want to host your GraphQL endpoint in SvelteKit, you can configure `schemaPath` to look at files with a  glob expression.

2/ To avoid conflits, you should write your operations in only 2 files extensions: 
- `*.svelte`
- `*.gql`

_(`*.graphql` will be exclusively for graphql server definition)_

Example 👇

<br />
```js 
/* file: houdini.config.js */

/** @type {import('houdini').ConfigFile} */
const config = {
	schemaPath: 'src/**/*.graphql',
	sourceGlob: 'src/**/*.{svelte,gql}',
};

export default config;
```
_More about the [config](https://www.houdinigraphql.com/api/config)_






### Scripts Tweaks

Run the cmd `houdini generate` to get everything ready for your application: stores, types, cache, ... everything!

Usually, we add it in the `package.json` like below, to be able to extend the `gen` cmd later with other generators.

```json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "svelte-kit sync && npm run gen",
    "gen": "yarn gen:houdini",
    "gen:houdini": "houdini generate",
  }
  // ...
}
````
