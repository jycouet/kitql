# ⚡How to - vite-plugin-watch-and-run

<PackageInstall packages={['-D @kitql/vite-plugin-watch-and-run']} />

In your `svelte.config.js` add a watchAndRun with the following configuration:

- watch: a glob pattern to watch for changes
- a run command to run when a file change is detected

_(for now it's only codegen, but later it will be more!)_

```js
import watchAndRun from '@kitql/vite-plugin-watch-and-run';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		vite: {
			plugins: [
				watchAndRun([
					{
						watch: '**/*.(gql|graphql)',
						run: 'yarn gen'
						// delay: 500, Optional parameter to delay the run command.
					}
				])
			]
		}
	}
};

export default config;
```

`delay` is good in case you have 200 files added realy fast! Like this the cmd is executed only once.
