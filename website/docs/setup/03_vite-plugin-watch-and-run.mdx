# âš¡How to - vite-plugin-watch-and-run

<br />
## Installation

If you have `@kitql/all-in` you don't need to install this manually.

If you want to install it stand alone, please do

<PackageInstall packages={['-D @kitql/vite-plugin-watch-and-run']} />

<br />
## Configuration In your `vite.config.js` add watchAndRun with the following configuration:

- `watch`: a glob pattern to watch for changes. This will be matched against the _absolute path_ for altered files.
- `run`: a command to trigger when a file change is detected (You can be very creative ðŸ¥³!)

```js
import watchAndRun from '@kitql/vite-plugin-watch-and-run'
import path from 'path';

/** @type {import('vite').UserConfig} */
const config = {
  plugins: [
    watchAndRun([
      {
        name: 'gen',
        watchKind: ['add', 'change', 'unlink'],
        watch: path.resolve('src/**/*.(gql|svelte)'),
        run: 'npm run gen',
        delay: 300
      }
    ])
  ],
};

export default config;
```

<br />
## List of `watchKind`
Default list when not set: `['add', 'change', 'unlink']`

Other possible events: `"addDir", "all", "error", "raw", "ready", "unlinkDir"`.

## Side Notes

- `delay` is good in case you have 200 files added realy fast! Like this the cmd is executed only once.

- For the `run` command we recommend to use `npm run xxx` as it will work for `npm`, `yarn` and `pnpm` ðŸ™ƒ
