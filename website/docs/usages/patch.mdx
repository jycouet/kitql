# Patch

You can put manualy some data in a store (and the associated cache).
This is usefull for:

- Optimistic UI
  - 1/ You patch with some data you belive will be true
  - 2/ You do a mutation
  - 3/ You patch with the result of the mutation
- Partial Result & Navigation
  - 1/ You have a list of `Post.title` and you want to navigate to the detail of the post
  - 2/ Arriving on the detail page, you patch with the title
  - 3/ You do the detail query in the background
  - 4/ When data comes back, it will automatically update the store!

```ts
KQL_AllContinents.patch({ continents: [{ name: 'JYC Land', code: 'JYC' }] });
```
