<Aside type="tip">
  _**KitQL** itself is not a library, it's "nothing" but a collection of standalone libraries._
</Aside>

A set of handles and utilities for request handling customization in SvelteKit ðŸ«µ!

## Installation

```sh
npm i -D @kitql/handles
```

## Utilities

- `handleProxies` - implements a reverse proxy that forwards from a path to a given external
  service. Useful for hiding a backing service from clients.
- `handleCors` - applies CORS headers to set of defined routes. The configuration options allowed
  per route are a subset of those used by the
  [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors#configuration-options) package, for easy migration.
- `handleCsrf` - allows cross-site form submissions to a set of defined routes. The allowed origins
  for submissions can be configured per route. For all other routes, implements the default CSRF
  behavior of SvelteKit, where all cross-site form submissions are blocked.
- `createCorsWrapper` - creates a wrapper around a `RequestHandler` that adds CORS headers to the
  request. This allows enabling CORS on one specific route `+server.ts` without needing to modify
  `hooks.server.ts`.

## Required SvelteKit / Vite Configuration Changes

### `handleCsrf`

To use `handleCsrf`, disable SvelteKit's default CSRF blocking behavior. `handleCsrf` will duplicate
the behavior of the default CSRF blocking for any routes that are not specifically configured.

```js
// svelte.config.js
const config = {
  kit: {
    // ... other kit options
    // disable sveltekit built-in CSRF blocking - this is replaced by `handleCsrf`
    csrf: {
      checkOrigin: false
    }
  }
}
```

### `handleCors` and `createCorsWrapper`

Not strictly necessary, but recommended: when using `handleCors` or `createCorsWrapper`, disable
Vite's default addition of wildcard CORS headers in
[development](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options#server-cors) and
[preview](https://vitejs.dev/config/preview-options#preview-cors) mode. This allows you to test your
CORS configuration as it would behave in production.

Note that you need to specify `cors: { origin: false }` rather than disabling cors entirely with
`cors: false`, as the SvelteKit vite plugin
[adds its own CORS configuration](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/2b19df3855b13737399a7173f25e4fecbd7f689a/packages/kit/src/exports/vite/index.js#L262)
with `cors: { preflightContinue: true }`. This is not included in the warning logging for overriden
config entries due to [a SvelteKit vite plugin issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/12574).

```ts
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ... plugins, etc
  // disable automatic CORS header addition in dev
  server: {
    cors: {
      origin: false
    }
  },
  // disable automatic CORS header addition in preview
  preview: {
    cors: {
      origin: false
    }
  }
})
```

## Usage

### `handleProxies`

Creates a handler which, for requests matching a given path prefix in the given options, proxies the
request to the `to` URL in the corresponding `ProxyOptions`. Any path elements after the matching
prefix are preserved, e.g. a request to `/from/some/other/path` will be proxied to
`to/some/other/path`. The request method, body, and headers are preserved, with the exception of the
`Host` header which is set to the proxy target hostname.

If a `requestHook` is defined, it is called with the original request event before the returned
request is proxied. This allows for modifying the request before it is sent, e.g. to add or remove
authentication headers, api keys, etc. If the returned request is to a URL with the same origin as
the initial request and a path that also starts with the current path prefix, that request path is
proxied; otherwise, the returned request path is not modified before it is fetched. If the
`requestHook` function throws, the request is not proxied and a response corresponding to the thrown
object (matching Sveltekit endpoint behavior) is returned to the client instead.

If multiple options entries would match a request, the first matching entry is used.

For requests matching a path prefix in options that do not have an `Origin` header or that have an
`Origin` header not matching the request's origin, a 403 Forbidden response is returned. This
prevents use of the proxy by other browser applications, but (**IMPORTANT**) does not prevent abuse
of the proxy by applications that can set the `Origin` header manually to match. To prevent this,
you can require user authentication and authorization before allowing proxying, validating either in
a preceding hook or directly in the `requestHook`.

```ts
// src/hooks.server.ts
import { sequence } from '@sveltejs/kit/hooks'

import { handleProxies } from '@kitql/handles'

export const handle = sequence(
  // Forwards all requests to paths beginning with `/proxy` to
  // `http://my.super.website/graphql`. Subpaths are preserved, e.g. `/proxy/api/path` is
  // forwarded to `http://my.super.website/graphql/api/path`.
  handleProxies([['/proxy', { to: 'http://my.super.website/graphql' }]])
)
```

This way, customers will never see the url `http://my.super.website/graphql`.
