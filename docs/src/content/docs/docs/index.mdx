## Our approach to accessibility

Accessibility isn't an afterthought in Accessible Astroâ€”it's our foundation. We follow the WAI-ARIA guidelines and WCAG 2.2 standards to ensure our components and themes work for everyone, regardless of how they interact with the web.

## Key principles

### 1. Semantic HTML

- Using proper HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.)
- Maintaining logical heading hierarchy
- Providing meaningful landmarks
- Using lists for navigation items

<Aside type="tip" title="Color contrast">
  All our components meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA contrast requirements by default, with many meeting the
  stricter AAA level.
</Aside>

## User preferences

We respect user preferences through:

```css
/* Reduced motion */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Motion-based animations are disabled */
}

/* Color scheme */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Dark mode styles */
}

/* Contrast (coming soon) */
@media (prefers-contrast: more) {
  /* High contrast styles */
}
```
