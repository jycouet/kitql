<Aside type="tip">
	_**KitQL** itself is not a library, it's "nothing" but a collection of standalone libraries._
</Aside>

Over the years, we have been building a lot of apps with Svelte & SvelteKit, and we keep repeating
same things over and over again. So we decided to build libraries that will help us SpeedRun our
WebApps development.

You have some general questions? We have some answers! 🤞 check out our [F.A.Q.](/docs/faq)
